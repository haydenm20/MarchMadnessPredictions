# March Madness Predictions

This project explored a few different models to develop predictions 
for the NCAA Basketball Championships also known as March Madness. The data
contains information from both the regular and post seasons of college basketball
for 2003 to 2017. The models used were a generalized linear model, neural network, and 
Earth model. They were evaluated using both log loss and their overall accuracy. 

A more detailed explanation and review of the project can be found in the 
report stored in the repository.
